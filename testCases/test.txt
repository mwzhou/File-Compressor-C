The only aspect that really matters with the codebook is that each token has its own unique bit sequence. So long as each token has this, then it does not matter which file or location you swap out the tokens for their codes are. Creating the Huffman Tree just ensures that this happens and to create it you need the frequencies of each token, but the frequencies themselves are just to ensure you end up with the smallest possible unique bit sequences for all tokens. Whether using one file or multiple files, you record each token and its corresponding frequency, then using this you can now create and use the codebook on all the files you just got the tokens from.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
REGULAR TEST CASES
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

TEST CASE 0: run -b, -c, and -d on an empty file
	Run:
		./fileCompressor -b ./empty.txt
		./fileCompressor -c ./empty.txt ./HuffmanCodebook
		./fileCompressor -d ./empty.hcz ./HuffmanCodebook
	
	Files/Directories:
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[empty.txt] (empty):
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	Output: 
		none
	
	Result: 
		runs as expected. 100% match from original file and decompressed file in the end.
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[HuffmanCodebook](created in executable directory):
		\
		<new line>
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[empty.txt.hcz] (empty):
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[empty.txt] (empty):
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	Remarks:
		Technically an empty file is valid, so the Huffman Codebook wouldn't be empty, it just wouldn't have any tokens.





TEST CASE 0.5: run all flags on an empty directory
	Run: 
		./fileCompressor -b /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/empty_dir/
		./fileCompressor -c /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/empty_dir/ ./HuffmanCodebook				
		./fileCompressor -d /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/empty_dir/ ./HuffmanCodebook



	Files/Directories:
		===================================================================================
		DIRECTORY - empty_dir:
			contents: (nothing)
		===================================================================================
	
	Results:
		Runs as expected. empty_dir is still empty since there's no files to compress/decompress.
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[HuffmanCodebook](created in executable directory):
		\
		<new line>
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		===================================================================================
		DIRECTORY - empty_dir:
			contents: (nothing)
		===================================================================================

	Remarks:
		Simillar to test case 0, the Huffman Codebook would still exist, it's just empty.




TEST CASE 1: run flags on a random file in any order
	Run:
		./fileCompressor -b -R <file_name>
		./fileCompressor -d -R <file_name>
		./fileCompressor -R -c <file_name> ./Huffman Codebook
	
	Remarks:
		as long as all arguments are the same in the format specified, the order of the flags doesn't matter. 
		They are treated the same and have the same exact result.




TEST CASE 2: run all flags on a file with a single word
	Run: 
		./fileCompressor -b /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/single_word.pdf
		./fileCompressor -c /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/single_word.pdf ./HuffmanCodebook				
		./fileCompressor -d /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/single_word.hcz ./HuffmanCodebook


	Files/Directories:
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[single_word.pdf] (in DIR /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/): 
		hello
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	Results:
		Runs as expected.
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[HuffmanCodebook](created in executable directory):
		\
		0	\n
		1	hello
		<new line>
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[single_word.pdf.hcz](created in /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/):
		10
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[single_word,pdf](created in /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/):
		hello
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Remarks:
		Note: Test Case 2 is also testing for a different file extension other than .txt and also running a file in a different directory other than the executable.
		Note: the Huffman Codebook accounts for the \n at the end of a file from the text editor. The decompressed file is still exactly the same.


TEST CASE 2.5: run all flags on a FILE but pass in -R flag
	Run: 
		./fileCompressor -b -R /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/single_word.pdf
			Output:
				passed in -R flag but only passed in a REGULAR file, will run flag as if NOT recursive
		./fileCompressor -R -c /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/single_word.pdf ./HuffmanCodebook
			Output:
				passed in -R flag but only passed in a REGULAR file, will run flag as if NOT recursive					
		./fileCompressor -R -d /ilab/users/mwz7/Desktop/k/single_word.hcz ./HuffmanCodebook
			Output:
				passed in -R flag but only passed in a REGULAR file, will run flag as if NOT recursive
					
	Files: 
		same as above
		
	Results:
		runs as expected.
		same as above
		
	Remarks:
		If user passes in a single word but also the R flag, the program treats it as if no R flag in the first place.




TEST CASE 3: run all flags on a file of words with just a single delimiter (some words have duplicates). File has a large number of words.
	
	Run:
		./fileCompressor -b ./testCases/test.txt
		./fileCompressor -c ./testCases/test.txt ./HuffmanCodebook
		./fileCompressor -d ./testCases/test.hcz ./HuffmanCodebook
			
	Files:
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		[test.txt] (in DIR /testCases/):
		The only aspect that really matters with the codebook is that each token has its own unique bit sequence. So long as each token has this, then it does not matter which file or location you swap out the tokens for their codes are. Creating the Huffman Tree just ensures that this happens and to create it you need the frequencies of each token, but the frequencies themselves are just to ensure you end up with the smallest possible unique bit sequences for all tokens. Whether using one file or multiple files, you record each token and its corresponding frequency, then using this you can now create and use the codebook on all the files you just got the tokens from.
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	Results:
		Everything runs as expected. The end-result decompressed file has a 100% match with the original file.

	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
	CHAPTER ONE
	THE BOY WHO LIVED
	Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
	that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
	people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
	because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
	Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
	drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
	have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
	nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
	spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
	neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
	opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
	The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
	their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
	think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
	Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
	in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
	sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
	possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
	say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
	Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy
	was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want
	Dudley mixing with a child like that.
	When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
	starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
	strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the
	country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
	work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
	Dudley into his high chair.
	None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
	At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
	Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,
	2
	because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
	walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got
	into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
	It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
	something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley
	didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to
	look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet
	Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking
	of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and
	stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the
	corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now
	reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats
	couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
	put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of
	nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
	But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
	else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help
	noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
	about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in
	funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this
	was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering
	wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite
	close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was
	enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man
	had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
	nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some
	silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...
	yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.
	Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
	Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
	ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate
	on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad
	daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed
	open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never
	seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly
	normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made
	several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a
	very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs
	and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
	3
	He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
	them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't
	know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering
	excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on
	his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he
	caught a few words of what they were saying.
	"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry"
	Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
	whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better
	of it.
	He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
	secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost
	finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the
	receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was
	being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were
	lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think
	of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even
	seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point
	in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her
	sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all
	the same, those people in cloaks...
	He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
	when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that
	he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
	"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It
	was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a
	violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the
	ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in
	a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir,
	for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at
	last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,
	happy day!"
	And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
	Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
	stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that
	was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping
	4
	he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he
	didn't approve of imagination.
	As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --
	and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that
	morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the
	same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
	"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a
	stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying
	to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
	determined not to mention anything to his wife.
	Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all
	about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had
	learned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When
	Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to
	catch the last report on the evening news:
	"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's
	owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally
	hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been
	hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since
	sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly
	changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin.
	"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going
	to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
	"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not
	only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as
	Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead
	of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting
	stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's
	not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."
	Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
	Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?
	And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...
	Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was
	no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat
	nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister
	lately, have you?"
